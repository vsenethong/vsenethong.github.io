                    <em>Cars</em> is set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic vehicles. The film follows a selfish and arrogant young racecar named Lightning McQueen who, on the way to the most important race of his life, becomes stranded in a forgotten town along U.S. Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he learns about friendship and begins to reevaluate his priorities.

                In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the Dinoco 400 race marks the climax of the Piston Cup season. The event intensifies a rivalry between the retiring seven-time champion, Strip "The King" Weathers, the cunning Chick Hicks, and the talented but arrogant rookie, Lightning McQueen. Struggling with teamwork due to his self-centered attitude, Lightning is desperate to win the Piston Cup and gain a sponsorship from the prestigious Dinoco team. He resents his current "small-time" sponsor, Rust-Eze Bumper Ointment, and the "rusty old cars" who use it. During the high-stakes race, Lightning avoids a major collision instigated by Chick but loses the lead by refusing to take a pit stop, causing his rear tires to blow out on the final lap. The race ends in a three-way tie, setting the stage for a decisive tiebreaker race at the Los Angeles International Speedway in one week.

                After the race, Lightning rushes through the night on Interstate 40 to reach California inside his transport truck, Mack. A group of delinquent teenage tuner cars cause Mack to fall asleep and push him onto the rumble strips on the interstate shoulder, with an ensuing mishap leading to Lightning being stranded alone in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, where he inadvertently damages the main road. Lightning is sentenced to a community service assignment: repaving the road under the supervision of the town's judge Doc Hudson, a Hudson Hornet who is prejudiced against Lightning for being a race car.

                The development of Cars began in 1998, when Pixar finished production of A Bug's Life. At that time, Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world inspired by The Ugly Duckling, an idea triggered by the poor reception his fellow countrymen gave the Mini-El car.[10] Some of the original drawings and characters were developed in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars could be the next Pixar film after A Bug's Life and be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4.[10] However, the idea was scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2.[10] Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc and a few other characters bigger parts.[10]

                For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company.[11] Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.[11]

                In 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way."[11]

                Cars was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was moved to June 9, 2006.[20] Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney.[21] When Pixar's chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the rea

                Cars was released on DVD, in wide- and full-screen editions, on November 7, 2006, in the United States and Canada.

                In its opening weekend, Cars earned $60 million in 3,985 theaters in the United States, ranking number one at the box office.[35] For three years, it would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for any car-oriented film until it was surpassed by Fast & Furious in 2009.[36] In the United States, the film held onto the number one spot for two weeks before being surpassed by Click and then by Superman Returns the following weekend.[37][38][39] The film then earned $33.7 million during its second weekend while competing against The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Nacho Libre.[40] Later on, Cars would team up with another Disney film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, which was released a month later. Around this time, it had approached the $200 million mark, becoming the third film of the year to do so, following X-Men: The Last Stand and The Da Vinci Code.[41] It went on to gross $462 million worldwide and $244 million in the United States.[42] Cars was the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2006, behind Ice Age: The Meltdown.[43]
