    <p> Hello, my name is Vanessa Senethong <em>(she/her)</em>!</p>

    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> I am a sophmore at CU Boulder with as a computer science major with a creative technology and design minor.</p>
    <p> Outside of school I love creating-- whether that is drawing, crafting, filming, photography-- I am probably doing that!</p>
    <p> Aside from my artistic endeavors, I also enjoy reading, weightlifting, and socializing. </p>

    <h2> Goals</h2>
    <p> My goals for this course is to work on a website of my own. I am taking Software Development this semester along with
        this course, and my hopes is to create an interactive website that looks aesthetically pleasing to call my own.
